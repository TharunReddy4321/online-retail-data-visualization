# Executive Questions for Online Retail Business Analysis

## CEO Questions (Strategic & Financial Focus)

### 1. What is our strategy to reverse the 42% revenue decline from November to December 2011, and what are the key drivers behind this significant drop?
**Rationale:** The data shows a dramatic revenue decline from £1.46M to £434K between November and December 2011. As CEO, understanding whether this is seasonal, operational, or market-driven is critical for strategic planning and investor confidence.

### 2. How can we reduce our dangerous customer concentration risk where just 10% of customers drive 51% of revenue, and what's our customer acquisition and retention strategy?
**Rationale:** This extreme customer concentration presents significant business risk. The CEO needs to understand customer diversification strategies, acquisition costs, and retention programs to build a more sustainable revenue base.

### 3. What is our international expansion strategy given that we're leaving 16% of potential revenue (£1.56M) on the table with only 5 key international markets, while the UK dominates at 84%?
**Rationale:** With 38 countries represented but UK generating 84% of revenue, there's clear opportunity for international growth. The CEO needs to evaluate market entry strategies, localization costs, and expansion ROI.

### 4. How do we optimize our operational efficiency when our return rate of 1.96% is costing us nearly £900K annually, and what does this indicate about our product quality and customer satisfaction?
**Rationale:** Returns represent both a direct cost (£896K) and potential quality/satisfaction issues. The CEO needs to understand if this is acceptable for the industry or requires operational improvements.

## CMO Questions (Marketing & Customer Focus)

### 1. What customer segmentation and personalization strategies can we implement to increase the average order frequency from 5.1 orders per customer to drive higher customer lifetime value?
**Rationale:** With average CLV of £1,898 and only 5.1 orders per customer, there's significant opportunity to increase purchase frequency through targeted marketing, loyalty programs, and personalization.

### 2. How can we optimize our marketing spend and channel strategy to capitalize on the Thursday peak sales (£2.1M) and 12 PM peak hour (£1.36M) patterns?
**Rationale:** Clear temporal patterns suggest optimal timing for marketing campaigns, email sends, social media posts, and promotional activities. The CMO needs to align marketing activities with these behavioral patterns.

### 3. What localized marketing strategies should we develop for our top 5 international markets (Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, Australia) to increase their revenue contribution beyond the current £1.1M combined?
**Rationale:** International markets show promise but may need culturally adapted marketing approaches, local partnerships, and region-specific campaigns to realize their full potential.

### 4. How can we leverage our product portfolio of 4,070 SKUs more effectively, given that one product generates £206K while the average is only £2,395 per SKU?
**Rationale:** The huge variance in product performance suggests opportunities for better product marketing, cross-selling, bundling strategies, and potentially discontinuing underperforming items to focus marketing resources on winners.
